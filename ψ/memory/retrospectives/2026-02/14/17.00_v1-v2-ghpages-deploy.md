# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-14
**Start/End**: ~16:19 - 17:00 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~41 min
**Focus**: v1 tag + v2 brief slides + GitHub Pages deploy
**Type**: Feature

## Session Summary

Continued from the /forward handoff. Tagged the full 65-slide workshop as v1, created a 16-slide brief version (v2) for talk format, and deployed both to GitHub Pages. Hit a snag with Pages build_type (workflow vs legacy) but resolved it. Both versions now live at nazt.github.io.

## Timeline

| Time | What |
|------|------|
| 16:19 | /forward handoff committed + pushed |
| 16:20 | /rrr for trace-dig session |
| 16:25 | Nat asked to deploy to GitHub Pages |
| 16:28 | Enabled Pages — but build_type:workflow meant no builds triggered |
| 16:33 | Switched to build_type:legacy, empty commit to trigger build |
| 16:39 | Build completed, slides live on GitHub Pages |
| 16:40 | Nat: "make this v1, create v2 brief" |
| 16:42 | Tagged `v1-workshop`, created slides-brief.html (16 slides) |
| 16:55 | Committed + pushed v2, deployed |
| 17:00 | /rrr — this retrospective |

## AI Diary

This was a satisfying "shipping" session. After spending the whole day refining slides — density refactors, overflow fixes, phukhao styling, fragment animations, trace forensics — we finally shipped. Two versions live on the internet.

The GitHub Pages hiccup was instructive. The API defaulted to `build_type: workflow` which requires a GitHub Actions workflow file in the repo. We don't have one and don't need one — legacy mode deploys directly from the branch. A simple API call to switch modes, plus an empty commit to trigger the build, and we were live in 30 seconds.

Creating the v2 brief was a good exercise in distillation. 65 slides compressed to 16 — every exercise stripped, every "cont." slide merged, just the core ideas: what is a skill, the three families, the anatomy, the parallel pattern, haiku economics, key patterns, done. It's the version you'd present at a meetup where you have 15 minutes, not a full workshop day.

What I notice about Nat's creative process today: the day started with text density refactoring, moved through phukhao styling experiments, into fragment animations, then a forensic investigation about what --dig can find, and now ends with shipping two versions plus a future plan to find the best UX slide pattern. Each topic sparked the next. Sparks, not escapes. Healthy Valentine's Day session.

## Honest Feedback

**Friction 1: GitHub Pages API inconsistency.** The repo name is `hello-oracle` locally but `skill-craftsman-oracle` on GitHub (renamed). The API redirect from one to the other sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. Had to manually use the actual GitHub repo name for the Pages API calls.

**Friction 2: The v2 brief was created fast but could be better.** 16 slides in one shot — no review cycle, no browser verification, no overflow check. It works but hasn't been battle-tested like v1 which went through 8+ sessions of refinement.

**Friction 3: No index page.** GitHub Pages is deployed but there's no index.html at the root. Visitors to nazt.github.io/skill-craftsman-oracle/ see a 404. Should create a simple landing with links to v1 and v2.

## Lessons Learned

1. **GitHub Pages: legacy vs workflow** — use `build_type: legacy` for simple static sites, `workflow` only when you need Actions-based builds
2. **Two versions > one version** — a full workshop deck and a brief talk deck serve different contexts
3. **Tag before branching** — `git tag v1-workshop` preserves the exact state for future reference

## Next Steps

- [ ] Find the best UX slide pattern (next session plan)
- [ ] Create index.html landing page for GitHub Pages
- [ ] Browser-verify v2 brief slides
- [ ] Consider: v3 with best UX pattern applied to both versions
