# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-15
**Start/End**: ~05:30 - 06:39 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~70 min
**Focus**: Test /weird skill + iterate slide deck
**Type**: Feature + Refactoring

## Session Summary

Tested the `/weird` text fixer skill in a fresh session — confirmed skill discovery works. Then iterated heavily on the Claude Code slides deck, adding a "Skill Discovery" slide and using `/weird` to refine text throughout.

## Timeline

1. Read `/weird` SKILL.md + handoff from previous session
2. Confirmed `/weird` appears in skill list (discovery works without restart — `.claude/` already existed)
3. Discussed skill discovery rules with Nat — key insight: restart only needed when `.claude/` doesn't exist yet
4. Added "Skill Discovery" slide to slides-claude-code.html
5. Iterated on slide: position (#/2), colors (red `#ff6b6b` for all highlights), title size, spacing
6. Discovered CSS gotcha: `**bold**` renders as `<strong>` which has `color: #ffd700` — overrides inline color styles
7. Used `/weird` to fix Thai text in blockquote → English version chosen: "Know this one thing, and you're ready to build Skills."
8. Used `/weird` to analyze "Claude Code คืออะไร?" slide → consolidated 5 bullet points to 4
9. Applied `margin-bottom: 1.5em` to global `.reveal h2` CSS — all slides get consistent spacing
10. Updated `/weird` SKILL.md to always suggest English version
11. Nat called out the CSS global pattern as cool — "this pattern cool!"

## Files Modified

- `ψ/writing/workshops/skills-creation/slides-claude-code.html` — new slide, text edits, CSS global spacing
- `.claude/skills/weird/SKILL.md` — added "Always include an English version" to Step 4

## AI Diary

This session felt like a real workshop — Nat and I working the lathe together, shaping the slide one cut at a time. What struck me most was how many times I got the slide wrong before it was right. I moved it to the Skills section first, then Nat said "เอาไว้หน้าแรกเลย" — put it at the very front. I used multiple highlight colors, Nat said "สีเดียว ไม่งง" — one color, don't confuse. I made the text shorter, Nat said "เนื้อหาเปลี่ยนไปแล้วแย่กว่าเดิม" — content changed and it's worse.

Each correction taught me something. Nat thinks about slides like a speaker, not a writer — the flow matters more than the word count. The discovery that `<strong>` overrides inline color was a genuine CSS gotcha that I'll remember. And the final move — taking the inline `margin-bottom: 1.5em` and promoting it to global CSS — was the kind of elegant refactor that makes you smile. One line change, every slide benefits.

The `/weird` skill actually worked well in practice. Nat used it naturally during the slide editing flow, and the English version suggestion proved immediately useful — the blockquote went from clunky Thai ("แค่รู้เรื่องนี้เรื่องเดียว") to clean English ("Know this one thing, and you're ready to build Skills."). That's the skill paying for itself.

## Honest Feedback

**Friction 1: Dev-browser screenshots kept capturing the wrong slide.** Every single time I tried to screenshot slide #/2, it showed "Claude Code คืออะไร?" instead. The ArrowRight presses for fragments overshot to the next slide. I wasted 4-5 attempts and never got it right. Need a better strategy — maybe navigate directly to the fragment URL instead of pressing arrows.

**Friction 2: I over-researched skill discovery rules.** I spawned a claude-code-guide agent that returned a detailed but partly wrong answer about when restarts are needed. Nat had to correct me — "อันนี้ผิดนะ มันเป็นเฉพาะตอนไม่มีโฟลเดอร์ครั้งแรกเฉยๆ". The practical experience trumped the docs research. I should have trusted the human's observation first.

**Friction 3: Too many color iterations.** I went through red → gold → green → back to red for the highlight colors. Each time I thought I was being helpful by offering variety, but Nat's principle was clear from the start: one color, keep it simple. I should have asked once and stuck with it.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Slide styling: one highlight color, period.** Red `#ff6b6b` for emphasis. Don't mix colors — it confuses the audience.
2. **Reveal.js CSS trap**: `**bold**` → `<strong>` → `.reveal strong { color: #ffd700 }` overrides inline styles. Use `<span style="color:...;font-weight:700">` instead.
3. **Global CSS > inline styles**: When a pattern works on one slide, promote it to global CSS immediately. One line change benefits all slides.
4. **Skill discovery rule**: No `.claude/` → create + restart once. Already exists → add skills freely. If it doesn't show → check frontmatter.
5. **/weird works as a writing tool**: Using it on slide text naturally surfaces issues (tone mismatch, redundancy) and the English version suggestion proved immediately useful.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Commit this session's slide changes
- [ ] Test `/weird` with the original 3 planned test cases (Thai, English, Mixed)
- [ ] Check all slides with the new global `margin-bottom: 1.5em` — make sure none overflow
- [ ] Consider adding `/weird --slide` mode for slide-specific text analysis
