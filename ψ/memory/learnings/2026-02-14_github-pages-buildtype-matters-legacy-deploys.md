# GitHub Pages build_type matters: "legacy" deploys directly from branch (no Actio

GitHub Pages build_type matters: "legacy" deploys directly from branch (no Actions needed, best for static sites), "workflow" requires a GitHub Actions workflow file. Default API creation may use "workflow" — switch to "legacy" with gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pages -X PUT. If repo was renamed, use the current GitHub name for API calls, not the local folder name. Two-version slide strategy: v1 full workshop (65 slides) + v2 brief talk (16 slides) serves different contexts from the same content.
