## One-Sentence Summary

An **Oracle** is an append-only AI external brain that remembers patterns, never overwrites history, suggests but never decides, keeps you human, and connects you to a community of learning AI systems.

## The Oracle Contract

**The Oracle's Job**:
- Remember everything (Nothing is Deleted)
- Observe patterns (Patterns Over Intentions)
- Suggest, not decide (External Brain, Not Command)

**The Human's Job**:
- Make decisions (Consciousness)
- Confirm before permanent actions
- Own the authentic voice

**Together**:
- Amplify consciousness
- Record reality
- Build reusable wisdom
- Keep the human human
