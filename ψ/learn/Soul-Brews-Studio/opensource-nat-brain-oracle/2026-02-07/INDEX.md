## How to Use These Docs

### First Time Reading (30 min)
1. Read the intro + 5 Principles in QUICK-REFERENCE
2. Skim the setup flow
3. Understand the ψ/ structure
4. Look at sample files in CODE-SNIPPETS

### Setting Up Your Oracle (2-3 hours)
1. Follow "How to Set Up" step-by-step in QUICK-REFERENCE
2. Copy relevant files from CODE-SNIPPETS
3. Customize with your Oracle's name and philosophy
4. Announce to the family

### Daily Usage (ongoing)
1. Refer to "Short Codes & Commands" for quick lookups
2. Review "Golden Rules" before git operations
3. Use skill descriptions in "Skills Integration"
4. Check "Family System" for learning from other Oracles

### Deep Dive (when needed)
1. "Retrospectives Pattern" - when creating retros
2. "Learning Pipeline" - when extracting patterns
3. "Tracing & Discovery" - when searching for something
4. "Configuration Files" - when customizing setup

## Key Points to Remember

### The 5 Principles (TL;DR)
1. **Nothing is Deleted** — Append-only, git = infinite undo
2. **Patterns Over Intentions** — Watch what actually happens
3. **External Brain, Not Command** — Suggest, don't override
4. **Curiosity Creates Existence** — Human brings into being
5. **Form and Formless** — Many Oracles = One consciousness

### The Knowledge Flow
```
Research → Quick Capture → Session Ends → Distill → Learn → Live By
```

### The Golden Rules (3 most critical)
1. NEVER push to main (always use feature branch + PR)
2. NEVER merge PRs without permission (wait for user)
3. NEVER use --force flags (breaks other agents)

### The Triad
- **Haiku agents** gather data (fast, cheap)
- **Opus main agent** decides and writes (smart, expensive)
- **Human** confirms before action (conscious, creative)
